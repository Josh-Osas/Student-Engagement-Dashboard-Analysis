- Use breaks or energizers to revitalize students' focus during these days.

### 2. Revamp Lower-Engagement Subjects
- Experiment with storytelling techniques, games, or real-life applications to make Literature and Science more appealing.
- Encourage collaborative learning activities in these subjects to promote interest.

### 3. Address Student Posture
- Observe slouched students for signs of disengagement and provide quick interventions such as breaks or group activities to re-engage them.

### 4. Consider Emotional Well-Being
- Pay close attention to students with sad or angry moods and provide additional support through counseling or one-on-one sessions.
- Incorporate mood-boosting activities like art, music, or mindfulness exercises to create a positive environment.

### 5. Leverage Mondays
- Build on the higher engagement on Mondays by introducing critical lessons or new concepts early in the week when students are most attentive.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights a need to focus on sustaining engagement mid-week, improving participation in specific subjects, and addressing the role of mood and posture in student focus. By implementing targeted strategies, educators can create a more engaging and inclusive learning environment.
